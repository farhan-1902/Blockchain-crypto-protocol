# Blockchain-crypto-protocol
A simple python implementation of a Proof-of-work based cryptocurrency that can be run using flask.
This program allows the user to create a blockchain on their own local network using flask. The aim is to demonstrate blockchains and show-off basic tasks like mining new blocks, sending a rudimentary transaction, connecting to nodes on a local network, using consensus to decide on the state of the chain, etc.
